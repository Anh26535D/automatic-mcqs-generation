Context:      The Yanomami live along the rivers of the rainforest in the north of Brazil.      They have lived in the rainforest for about 10,000 years and they use more than 2,000 different plants for food and for medicine.      But in 1988, someone found gold in their forest, and suddenly 45,000 people came to the forest and began looking for gold.      They cut down the forest to make roads.      They made more than a hundred airports.      The Yanomami people lost land and food.      Many died because new diseases came to the forest with the strangers.     In 1987, they closed fifteen roads for eight months.      No one cut down any trees during that time. In Panama, the Kuna people saved their forest.      They made a forest park which tourists pay to visit.      The Gavioes people of Brazil use the forest, but they protect it as well.      They find and sell the Brazil nuts which grow on the forest trees.
